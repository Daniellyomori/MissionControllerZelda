#MissionControllerZelda
Tears of the Kingdom is an open world game, with several missions spread across three map levels: sky, surface and underground. The game's mission checklist system, however, does not follow this complexity so well, only marking where the mission is given and a generic text, causing the player to forget the information if they play in more spaced periods.

The objective of this system will be to help players who spend periods without playing and forget information regarding missions. He will be able to register the game's mission, marking the related regions, and make notes that he deems necessary to complement the already existing information. In addition, he will also be able to score if the mission is completed.
